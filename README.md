# Focus Time App using Expo Snack

## Developing locally in Android Studio
- Open the Android Studio app and open up the Focus Time project
- Connect the physical device via USB cable to computer. 
- While in the root folder, run the command `expo start`
- You should see the Browser open with a url of `localhost:19002` 
- The Metro Bundler running in the browser should auto detect your device if it is connected. 
  - If it does not detect your device, you may need to enable developer tools. Steps to do that are here: `https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app`.
- You should be able to play around with the App on your physical device.

## Default Readme That comes with Exporting the Expo Snack App
Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://twitter.com/expo) or ask in our [forums](https://forums.expo.io/c/snack).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack).
